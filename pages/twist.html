Cinderella III: A Twist in Time is the second direct-to-video sequel to the 1950 Walt Disney Pictures animated classic Cinderella.
<br>Canonically it is a continuation of the original Cinderella, rather than Cinderella II: Dreams Come True, though due to its unusual
<br>chronological sequencing it acknowledges the events of Cinderella II: Dreams Come True by using some of its characters. The film
<br> was released on February 6, 2007 and was directed by Frank Nissen and features the voices of Jennifer Hale and Susanne Blakeslee.
<br> For the UK release of the film, it was simply titled Cinderella: A Twist in Time, without mention of it being a sequel. It made its 
<br>world television premiere on Toon Disney on December 3, 2007.
